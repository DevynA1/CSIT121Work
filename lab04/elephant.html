                This elephant image is a jpg file. Jpg stands for joint photographic experts group. 
                The elephant in the image represents loyalty, power, wisdom and fertility. I have 
                always loved elephants since I was younger, I see elephants as gentle giants which 
                is a very special meaning to me. Having power but not using it in a negative way, being wise
                and sharing that wisdom with others, remaining loyal to what and who you are. Elephants represent
                so much.
