                <p id="intro">This is my first webpage! The process of learning to code HTML has been challenging for me 
                    but I am getting the hang of it. I feel like learning how to code is like learning a new language. 
                    With learning a new language, of course you will run into some difficulties.</p>
            <article id="what-learned">
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>One thing I learned is how to structure an HTML. </li>
                    <li>Another thing I learned is the tags and stucture of an HTML is very important.</li>
                    <li class="special">The last thing that I learned is, it is okay to make mistakes. I just have to keep practicing. </li>
                </ol>
            </article>
                <p id="resources">Learning about the different tags for orderded and unorderd list was another exciting step. I learned from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_ordered.asp">Click here to learn about ordered list</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.programiz.com/html/unordered-list">Click here to learn about unordered list</a></li>
                    </ul>

                <p>This is a reflection for lab02. For the second lab of the semester, I enjoyed learning the different tags and structures
                     for HTML. Module 2 gave me the basic knowledge I needed to complete the assignment. The only thing I had an issue with was 
                     trying to figure out where the article and main structural elements in the code should go. I did a little more research other 
                     than the link given in the module, that helped me more. A resource I used to complete this assignment was the validator.
                    The validator helped a lot, to show me what I needed to fix in the code.</p>

                <p id="reflection"> This is a reflection for lab03. Styling the html was a litle difficult for me. I was 
                    actually trying to keep the colors matchig so the webpage would look decent. I did use a few
                    resources to help me better understand the styles syntax. Overall this was challenging but
                    with doing more research, I think I figured it out.</p>

                <p id="design-practice"> As I continue to learn about web design, I have noticed that it is important to 
                    follow best practices in design. Structuring the html and CSS correctly helps me with keeping the code organized
                    and easily accessible. Some practices I learned are keeping a consistant layout, maintaining a clear hierarchy in 
                    content and just to keep things simple. </p>
