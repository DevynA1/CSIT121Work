            <h2>How is InkML used?</h2>
            <p>Ink Markup Language(InkML) is used to capture and store data from pen-based input devices such as digital pens, stylus,
                and touchscreens. The format records the consistency of strokes made by the user, including attributes like timestamps, pressure, 
                and tilt of the stylus. Having these attributes helps capture the speed and flow of writing, also the pressure variation during
                drawing. InkML can be used through various note taking apps, drawing software, and e-signature platforms.</p>

            <p>InkML can be integrated into a variety of aplications and devices. In digital note taking, InkML allows handwritten notes and sketches 
               to be captured and stored in a structered format. This way it can easily search or convert into text using handwriting recognition algorithms.
               InkML is often used in web-based applications where users interact with drawing area. This enable a natural writing or drawing experience with
               a browser using technologies like Javascript.</p>

            <p>Another key use of InkML is it can interact with systems that involve collaborative or educational tools. Tools like e-learning platforms, digital
               whiteboards and virtual sketching environments, use InkML simultaneuosly. Allowing multiple users to draw and write, with each stroke being
               captured and rendered in real time across different devices. Without InkML the current technology being used in education , healthcare or all espects
               of everyday life that use digital pen-based input across different softwares, it would not be so easy to capture and store digital ink data. </p>
