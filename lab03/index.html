                <p>This is my first webpage! The process of learning to code HTML has been challenging for me 
                    but I am getting the hang of it. I feel like learning how to code is like learning a new language. 
                    With learning a new language, of course you will run into some difficulties.</p>

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>One thing I learned is how to structure an HTML. </li>
                    <li>Another thing I learned is the tags and stucture of an HTML is very important.</li>
                    <li class="special">The last thing that I learned is, it is okay to make mistakes. I just have to keep practicing. </li>
                </ol>
            </article>
                <p>Learning about the different tags for orderded and unorderd list was another exciting step. I learned from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_ordered.asp">Click here to learn about ordered list</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.programiz.com/html/unordered-list">Click here to learn about unordered list</a></li>
                    </ul>
                <p> This is a reflection for lab03. Styling the html was a litle difficult for me. I was 
                    actually trying to keep the colors matchig so the webpage would look decent. I did use a few
                    resources to help me better understand the styles syntax. Overall this was challenging but
                    with doing more research, I think I figured it out.</p>
