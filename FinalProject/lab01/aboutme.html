            <p>
                Hello everyone, my name is Devyn. I am 23 years old, I currently work a full time job as a service and sales 
                representative and I also work part time too while going to school full time. I really dont know how I am managing 
                all of this on my plate, but so far I am enjoying it. I hope everyone has a wonderful semester!

                Since I was 5 years old I have played softball, all the way until now. I am taking this fall season 
                off to focus on school and work but I plan on getting back on the field next year. Some skills I have 
                are being a team player, communication and I am good with people.
