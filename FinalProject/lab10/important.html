            <h2>Why is InkML important?</h2>
            <p>Ink Markup Language(InkML) is important because it provides a way to represent digital ink data. This is essential for pen-based
               interaction across multiple devices and platforms. Everyday digital handwriting and drawing is becoming more integrated into 
               everyday technology. The use of tablets, smartphones, digital whiteboards and even interactive kiosks have enforced InkML to become
               a very inportant feature in technology now and in the future.</p>

            <p>Another key aspect of InkML importance is, it is able to preserve the dynamic nature of ink input. InkML retains the sequence of 
               strokes, pressure, and even timing of each pen movement. Unlike static image formats, that only capture a snapshot of what is
               written or drawn. For industries like education, healthcare, or law this function can greatly improve workflow, data accuracy,
                and support many natural forms of interaction with digital devices.</p>   

            <p>InkML is also imprtant because it is extremely robust within digital ink technology. As digital ink technology continues to grow and 
               evolve InkML offer essentially a foundation that can adapt to new input methods and user needs. Having the support for various attributes
               like tilt, pressure sensitivity, and azimuth, this means that InkML can accommodate a large range of pen and touch devices. This makes InkML 
               a flexible tool that can be used in digital art and design, note taking and annotating documents.</p>
