            <h2>What is InkML?</h2>
            <p>Ink Markup Language(InkML) is an web standard that is designed to represent digital ink data.
               This feature is what allows handwriting, gestures, and other forms of pen and stylus inputs
               in a structured format. InkML allows for structered recording of strokes, which are the main elements 
               of drawing inputs and handwriting. With InkMl each stroke has information about its path, timestamps, pressure
               sensitivity and other attributes like tilt or azimuth. Applications that uses handwriting recognition, digital signatures
               and other forms of pen-based interactions makes InkMl very useful.</p>

            <p>InkML main benefit is the ability to capture the dynamic nature of handwritten or drawn input. InkML preserves the sequence
               and timing of pen movements, which provides more of a detailed and correct representation of the user's intentions. InkML
               allows for storage and retrieval of ink data, as well as the chance for munipulation, such as recognizing shapes or converting
               handwriting into text. In addition the format is greatly flexible, supporting various featues like multi-stroke input, geometric 
               transformations, and annotations. This makes it suitable for simple note taking applications or complex drawings.</p>

            <p>InkML is standardized by W3C(Worldwide Web), which means it is widely compatible across different platforms and devices. 
               It is often used in connection with web technologies, like HTML5 and Javascript, enabling interactivity in ink-based
               applications in web browsers. For example InkML can be turned into a digital whiteboard, e-signature platform, and other 
               educational tools. These are used so individuals can interact naturally with content by writing and drawing on screens.</p>
