                    <h2>Reflection on Final Project</h2>
                    <p>Completing this portfolio project was a challenging and rewarding experience. 
                       One of the biggest challenges was ensuring accessibility across all pages while 
                       also maintaining a clean professional design. I am very pleased with how each element 
                       of the website came together while also putting the requirements of the project as my first thought. 
                       Implementing responsive design using media queries was another challenge for me and I honestly don't 
                       believe I ever will get it all the way correct. Getting the webpage to adapt between desktop and mobile 
                       view was a struggle for me throughout this class. With more time and practice I believe I will get better at it. 
                       Testing the website on different browsers and devices was an eye-opening experience. This project taught me the 
                       importance of different browser checking and the need for robust. With this project I have been able to showcase my 
                       progression in web development and the importance binding to modern web standards.  </p>

                    <h2>Reflection on Web Standards course</h2>
                    <p>Throughout this course I have experienced a lot of ups and downs. I have gained a solid understanding of web development principles. 
                        I have learned the importance of proper hierarchy and structural elements. The power of CSS was very eye-opening, the transformation 
                        that CSS gives a webpage is incredible. Not only did I learn different skills and tools in web development, but I also learned a lot 
                        about myself. This was one of the more challenging courses I have taken. Throughout the semester I honestly wanted to give up because 
                        I was struggling with grasping the material and time management. Overall, this course has taught me a lot leaving me with a stronger 
                        understanding of best practices in web development and a sense of accomplishment in completing the course.</p>
